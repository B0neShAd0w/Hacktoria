![road-to-nowhere-cover-600x600](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117080369/203995873-780825ca-a4ac-4a57-a611-769fa301d8fb.png)

#### Difficulty: Medium

### **$\textcolor{Rhodamine}{Prologue:}$**
Onada stood guard at the entrance to the small village, hidden deep in the jungle. He was a mercenary, working for a terrorist organization called the Meercats. The Meercats were known for their brutal tactics and their willingness to do whatever it took to achieve their goals.

Onada had joined the Meercats for the money and the thrill of adventure, but as he stood watch over the village, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of unease. The villagers were poor and powerless, and Onada knew that his superiors would have no qualms about hurting them if it meant furthering their cause.

As the night wore on, Onada heard the sound of footsteps approaching from the jungle. He tensed, reaching for his rifle and preparing for the worst. But to his surprise, a group of rebels emerged from the foliage, their weapons trained on him.

Onada hesitated for a moment, torn between his loyalty to the Meercats and his growing sense of disgust at their methods. In the end, he made a decision. He lowered his rifle and stepped aside, allowing the rebels to pass.

As they moved into the village, Onada knew that he had made a risky move. The Meercats would surely come after him for his betrayal. But as he watched the rebels disappear into the jungle, Onada couldn’t help but feel a sense of relief and freedom. He had finally found the courage to stand up for what was right, and he knew that he would be able to sleep better at night as a result.

### **$\textcolor{Rhodamine}{Briefing:}$**
Special Agent K, we’ll be needing your assistance on a geolocation matter. One of our clients, a medium sized European goverment agency, has requested we find a needle in a haystack.

Our client is involved in fighting terrorist groups in Asia and Africa. Recently, they gained access to a Dropbox account filled with map data. Most of these seem to be related to safe houses used by a terrorist organization called “The Meercats”. Indeed a strange name, but nontheless, they mean business.

After having located most safehouses, our client is still struggling to locate a few of them. Since the operation to take down all of these locations needs to be synchronized. There’s an urgent need to identify them all before the next phase can begin.

Below you find an image of what appears to be a village, with a red marker to indicate the exact location. It’s your assignment to find where in the world this is. Currently we have reason to believe this is in Africa or Asia. But, given the organizations’ widespread members, this is only a guess at this time.

As always. Special Agent K, the contract is yours, if you choose to accept.

Use the coordinates you find as the password to open the ZIP archive. Inside, you find the flagfile to your Contract Card as always. Also, we heard the number 1920 is of importance in this case…

### Methodology:
The first step is to pull out imformation from the Mission Briefing that we feel is of importance.
* Asia and Africa

This doesn't give us much to go on, however there is a mention of the number `1920` which apparently is important!

Let's head over to my preferred online tool <a href="https://www.aperisolve.com/">Aperi'Solve</a> for these challenges and upload our image for analysis.

Click `Submit` and review the results.

Unfortunately this didn't bear any fruit.

One very useful feature of Aperi'Solve is it remembers passwords that other's have tried for that particular image but doesn't tell you if they work or not.

We can see that `1920` has been used in the past, if we remember back, we were told that `1920` is important!

Let's re-run with `I've got a password !` enabled and enter `1920`

Boom! we have found a `location.txt` file.

Let's download it and have a look...

The file contains some co-ordinates.

Extract the `flagfile-road-to-nowhere.zip` with the password from the information gained above to get your contract card.
