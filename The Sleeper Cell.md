### $\color{magenta}{PROLOGUE}$
Derek sat at his desk, staring at his computer screen in shock. An email had just appeared in his inbox, and it was from the Androktasiai group ‚Äì the terrorist organization he had secretly been a part of for years.

The message was brief and to the point: ‚ÄúActivation notice. Prepare for bombing mission.‚Äù

Derek‚Äôs heart raced as he read the words over and over again. He had always known that this moment might come, but he had never truly believed that it would. And now that it had, he wasn‚Äôt sure what to do.

On the one hand, Derek had always believed in the cause of the Androktasiai. He had joined the group because he believed that they were fighting for a just and noble cause ‚Äì to rid the world of the corrupt governments and institutions that oppressed the people.

On the other hand, Derek had always tried to distance himself from the more violent aspects of the group. He had always considered himself a ‚Äúsleeper cell‚Äù member ‚Äì someone who would lay low and only be activated when the time was right. He had never actually participated in any of the group‚Äôs bombings or attacks, and the thought of doing so now terrified him.

But Derek knew that he couldn‚Äôt back out now. He had made a commitment to the Androktasiai, and he couldn‚Äôt turn his back on them now. So, with a heavy heart, he began to prepare for the mission.

Over the next few days, Derek worked tirelessly to gather all of the materials and equipment that he would need for the bombing. He practiced making the explosives, memorized the target location, and even rehearsed his escape route.

All was ready now, Derek would do whatever is needed to rid this world of the greedy and gluttonous pigs that called themselves people.

### $\color{magenta}{BRIEFING}$
Greetings, Special Agent K.

We have an urgent matter on our hands. For several months we‚Äôve been investigating a group called ‚ÄúAndroktasiai‚Äù. A radical organization who believes in cleansing the planet of what they call gluttony. Believing firmly that humans are a disease that needs to be exterminated, this radical group is well organized and is preparing to strike several targets.

After breaching one of their email accounts, we were able to extract a sent item. The metadata didn‚Äôt prove to be of much help, as it was sent to a disposable 10minutemail address.

The contents however are of great interesting. We believe it contains instructions sent from one of the groups‚Äô leaders to a sleeper cell. This sleeper cell will now be activated and preparing to carry out an attack somewhere.

It is your task to figure out what the text means and provide any intelligence about the plans of this organization.

As always, Special Agent K. The Contract is yours, if you choose to accept.
