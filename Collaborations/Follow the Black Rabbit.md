He stood up, grabbed his laptop from the desk in the hope that writing it down, will finally granting him some sleep:

Today is james birthday (Saturday). He wished for the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù coffee beans that he needed for the magic coffee.

Since his parents are very rich, they bought him the 1000$ coffee beans he wished for.
