# Contract: The Listeners
![the-listeners-cover-image-600x600](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117080369/204564489-03244eb9-d8b4-4931-ad2f-487bac1f344a.png)

### Difficulty: Hard

### Mission Briefing:
Good day Special Agent K, glad you could make it. One of our oldest clients, a wealthy French businessman, is requesting we find a location where a conversation between two of his rivals will take place. These two have been after our clients’ fortune for a long time, endlessly scheming to end his business endeavors. After their recent attempt to sink one of our clients’ boats off the coast of Spain, while his wife and daughter were on board, our client has had enough.

The plan is to uncover the location of their meeting and have one of our Field Agents plant a listening device. This will record the meeting and lead to the valuable information our client is looking for. Using this information our client plans to take down the businesses of both rivals.

After their businesses are destroyed, we will be called upon again to fully end their existence. Something that, given the high profile of these men, wil make Hacktoria a hefty amount of money. As well as some very good standing with the French elite.

There is a catch to this however. We don’t know where this meeting will take place. Our client was able to intercept an image of the meeting location, which will take place 3 days from now at noon. Besides this photo, we know these rivals share a common interest in luxurious lifestyles along the coastlines of Western and Southern Europe.

Using this information and the intercepted image below, it is your task to figure out exactly where this meeting will take place. Our Field Agent closest to this region will take over from there.

As always. Special Agent K, the contract is yours, if you choose to accept.

### Methodology:
The first step is to pull out imformation from the Mission Briefing that we feel is of importance.
* French businessman
* off the coast of Spain
* luxurious lifestyles
* coastlines of Western and Southern Europe

After examining the supplied image, 2 elements jump out at me:
* Mirror
* House design/style

Uploading the image to <a href="https://lens.google.com/">Google Lens</a> and cropping on the `mirror` reveals these are Traffic Mirrors located in France.

We can do more investigation about these mirrors to confirm our findings.

This type of mirror seems to be a `TM-F French Premium traffic mirror`

With this in mind let's have a think about luxury areas of Southern/Western France - a few places spring to mind.
* Nice
* Cannes
* Monaco
* Saint-Tropez

Let's try and match the house style/design to the locations and try to mind a match.

After a fair bit of Googling and reading about the architecture of each area, the only one that seems to match is `Monaco`
