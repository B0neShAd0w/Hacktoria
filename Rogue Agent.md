### $\color{magenta}{PROLOGUE}$
Valentino Maggi was a secret agent working for the Italian government. He had been in the business for over a decade, and had seen and done it all. But this mission was unlike any other he had undertaken before.

It was a hot summer day in Rome, and Valentino was making his way through the winding streets of the city. He had been given the task of exchanging stolen documents with a Russian operative, who was rumored to have information that could potentially bring down the Italian government.

As he walked down a shadowy alley, he saw a figure leaning against the wall, smoking a cigarette. Valentino knew immediately that this was the man he had been sent to meet.

The Russian operative introduced himself as Sergei, and the two men got down to business. Valentino handed over the stolen documents, and in return, Sergei gave him a thumb drive containing the information the Italian government had requested.

The exchange was quick and efficient, and Valentino knew that he had completed his mission successfully. But as he walked away from the alley, he couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that he was being watched.

Turning back, he saw Sergei still standing in the same spot, a sly smile on his face. Valentino knew that this was not the last he would see of the Russian operative, and he knew that their next encounter would be even more dangerous than the last.

But Valentino was not one to back down from a challenge. He was a secret agent, after all, and he was ready for whatever came his way.

### $\color{magenta}{BRIEFING}$
Greetings Special Agent K. We have a request on our hands from our friends over at the CIA. In September of 2021, one of their operatives went missing in action. Upon further investigation, it was discovered this operative went rogue and started a smuggling business for the Russians. Mostly dealing in complex electronics, which have become difficult to come by for Russians after sanctions began.

The agent we‚Äôre looking for is named Valentino Maggi. Born in Brooklyn New York on 18.05.1987. Valentino is one of five sons of the Maggi family, who moved to the United States during World War II. Having grown up a middle class lifestyle, his father a car salesman and mother working as an elementary school teacher. Valentino was recruited into the CIA during his time as a student at Columbia University.

Most of his 10 years in active service were spent as an analyst working out of Langley. Recently though, in August of 2020, Valentino moved to oversees work. Being stationed in Italy as a liaison officer for the Italian foreign intelligence agency ‚ÄúAgenzia Informazioni e Sicurezza Esterna‚Äù.

Doing stellar work, right up until the point he went missing. Prompting an extensive investigation into his whereabouts. Documents were eventually found on his computer, recovered using forensics tools to recover deleted files. These indicate a heavy involvement with the Russian underground. Acquiring much needed microelectronics for the Russian government.

And that is where your task begins, Special Agent K. One of the files recovered from Valentino‚Äôs computer, is an image with a text file. We believe this to be the current location of Valentino Maggi. Locate the safehouse, so local authorities can raid the premises.

As always, Special Agent K. The contract is yours, if you choose to accept.

### $\color{magenta}{METHODOLOGY}$
Reading through the mission briefing doesn't really give us anything to go on, so the next step is to look at analyzing the image.

Nothing specific in the image we can really use to identify the location.

* Exiftool - nothing useful
* Aperi'Solve - nothing useful
* Google reverse image search - nothing useful
* Bing reverse image search - nothing useful
* Various other reverse image searches - nothing useful

Nothing of any interest yet.

At this point I am scratching my head a bit. however I am going to make the assumption that because this is a Medium difficulty challenge the `clue` we need must be right in front of us...

Let's head over to CyberChef and select `Open file as input` scanning through the Output, the only thing that stands out a little is the very last line, the very end looks odd. Is that a clue?

√¶√ä√§√Ñ√í√ÇZ√§√Ç√ñ√í√ú√Ç√ÜZhh\djrljhZdb\`jnphf

Let's copy this into CyberChef and select `Magic` from the Operation menu - nothing of interest.

Let's re-try with `Intensive mode` selected - boom! result...

REDACTED - no spoiler
