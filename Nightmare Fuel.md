### $\color{magenta}{PROLOGUE}$
For as long as she could remember, Mary had always been a light sleeper. So when she started hearing strange noises coming from the abandoned house next door every night, she knew that something was wrong.

At first, the noises were just soft and subtle, like the creaking of old floorboards or the rustling of leaves in the wind. But as time went on, they became louder and more intense, until they were almost unbearable.

There were horrible screeching sounds, like someone or something was in great pain, and Mary couldnâ€™t shake the feeling that something evil was lurking in the shadows.

She tried to ignore the noises, telling herself that it was just her imagination running wild. But as the weeks went by, the sounds became more and more frequent, until Mary couldnâ€™t take it anymore.

She knew that she had to do something, even if it meant facing her fears head on. So one night, when the noises were particularly loud, Mary gathered her courage and made her way over to the abandoned house.

As she approached the front door, she could feel her heart racing in her chest. She had no idea what she was going to find inside, but she knew that she had to keep going.

Slowly, she pushed open the door and stepped inside, her eyes scanning the darkness for any sign of movement. The house was empty and quiet, but Mary could still feel a sense of dread hanging in the air.

### $\color{magenta}{BRIEFING}$
Greetings Special Agent K. Yesterday evening around 2100 hours, two officers of the New York Police Department entered the premise of an abandoned building in Brownsville New York. Neighbors had complained about strange sightings. Supposedly a woman had been squatting inside the building.

Reports also state that over the course of the two years the building has been abandoned, several residents of the surrounding houses had complained about junkies occupying the building. Often making terrible screeching like noises during the night.

Normally, this would not get the attention of the NYPD, however, a neighborsâ€™ security camera had caught several people entering the building, but never seen them emerge. Upon closer inspection, a neighbor reported that all windows were closed and intact. Her security camera had also been on the whole time, surveying the only entrance to the building.

This eventually got the NYPD to investigate the building. While clearing rooms, the officers noticed someone moving around at the end of a hallway. Upon repeated calls and commands, the individual retreated behind a door. Both officers approached the door and told the person to come out. After a few seconds, we could see a woman move past the door frame.

Unresponsive to any commands given by the officers, they continued their search. Never to find the woman again. The officers called for backup and had a team of twelve officers and a K-9 unit sweep the building.

Nobody was ever found. Even the dog didnâ€™t find a trail. Which is odd, given all the smells clearly lingering around an old building like that. Strangely enough, upon inspecting the body cam footage, the audio appeared to be missing entirely.

We need you to take a look at the video and see what you can find.

As always, Special Agent K, the contract is yours. If your choose to accept.

### $\color{magenta}{METHODOLOGY}$
Is there anything useful in the mission briefing? doesn't seem we have much to go on here.

Watching the video clip doesn't give us anything useful, apart from nightmare's for a week...

Maybe there is something in the metadata of the video file? let's head over to <a href="https://www.metadata2go.com">MetaData2Go</a>, upload the video file and click `Start Analysing File`, once the process completes we can scan through the results, as we can see there is a `comment` - this looks promising, maybe it could be the password, let's chance our hand...

Extract the `flagfile-nightmare-fuel.zip` with the password from the information gained above to get your contract card.
