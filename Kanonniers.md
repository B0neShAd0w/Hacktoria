### Difficulty: Insane

### Mission Briefing:
Greetings, Special Agent K. We are on the hunt for operatives of a competing organization. We believe them to be the continuation of a rival Order “The Golden Creed”, who we eradicated mid 18th century. Somehow the family running the Order managed to reorganize and fund new endeavors. Flying under the radar for several years, they now have a foothold in many European countries.

Unfortunately for them, they’ve chosen to cross paths with some of our bigger clients in several of these countries. Most recently, the Dutch intelligence agency AIVD, started investigating them after being linked to a human trafficking ring. All beginning with the Syrian refugee crisis a few years back.

What made this Order fly under the radar for many years, is their total aversion for the digital world. Barely dipping their toes in web 1.0, The Golden Creed uses mostly analog means of communication. Making them infinitely harder to track.

Our friends at the AIVD however once observed a member of The Golden Creed insert a package into an opening of a monument. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be instructions for a hit being placed by a client of The Golden Creed.

This leads us to your objective. Last week, an operative of The Golden Creed was arrested by Dutch police. Carrying a picture with him of an old cannon. Given their tendency to hide information in historical objects, we believe this particular cannon is a location of interest. Possibly holding information, or being frequently used to pass information.

Our client has asked us to locate the cannon. Use the image below to find the location of the cannon.

As always. Special Agent K, the contract is yours, if you choose to accept.
