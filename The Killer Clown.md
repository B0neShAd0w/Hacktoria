### Difficulty: Easy

### Mission Briefing:

Greetings, Special Agent K. We have a very urgent case on our hands. The San Francisco Police Department is working on a true horror case this October. There is an actual killer clown roaming the streets of the greater San Francisco area.

The killer is dressed as a clown and strikes at night, mostly targeting women and younger men. The victims are drugged and bound tightly with a long rope, stretching all the way around the body. After this, the killer attaches an oxygen tank to the victim and puts them inside a coffin sized box. Making it impossible to move, but just enough to breathe slowly.

The victim is then buried alive and a picture is taken of the location, which is then sent to the police. With the amount of oxygen in the tank, victims usually last about 24 hours. Though with the panic setting in, some die within 6 hours. A few others suffered a heart attack from the panic. They are left as a game, for the police to find the location in time, or not. So far there have been several sightings of a clown at night, though only for brief moments. In one of the photo’s, the image of the clown was visible in a car mirror caught on camera.

About 30 minutes ago, the San Francisco Police Department received a new picture from the clown. This time we have reason to believe the victim is Melany Parker, a 23 year old woman from Northwest Berkeley. She was reported missing by her boyfriend, after she didn’t return from her evening jog.

Given the circumstances, we have no time to waste. Your assignment is simple, find the location of the picture below. Before the next victim dies, tied up in a box underground, slowly suffocating while tightly wrapped in ropes.

Special Agent K. The contract is yours, if you choose to accept.

### Process:
The details I feel are important have been highlighted in the MIssion Briefing above.
