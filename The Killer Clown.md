#### Difficulty: Easy

### **$\textcolor{Rhodamine}{Prologue:}$**
It was a dark and stormy night, and the only sound that could be heard in the park was the soft pattering of rain on the leaves. But among the bushes, there was something else lurking, something sinister and malevolent.

It was a killer clown, with a painted face and razor-sharp teeth. He had been hiding in the bushes for hours, waiting and observing the joggers as they passed by.

As the night wore on, the killer clown began to grow restless. He had been waiting for the perfect victim, and he knew that it wouldn’t be long before one came along.

Finally, he saw his chance. A lone jogger was making his way down the path, completely unaware of the danger that was lurking in the shadows.

The killer clown sprang from the bushes, his sharp claws glinting in the moonlight. The jogger never stood a chance.

As the body lay at his feet, the killer clown cackled maniacally, relishing in the power and control he had over life and death. Next, came the most sinister part of his plan…

### **$\textcolor{Rhodamine}{Briefing:}$**
Greetings, Special Agent K. We have a very urgent case on our hands. The San Francisco Police Department is working on a true horror case this October. There is an actual killer clown roaming the `streets of the greater San Francisco area.`

The killer is dressed as a clown and strikes at night, mostly targeting women and younger men. The victims are drugged and bound tightly with a long rope, stretching all the way around the body. After this, the killer attaches an oxygen tank to the victim and puts them inside a coffin sized box. Making it impossible to move, but just enough to breathe slowly.

The victim is then buried alive and a picture is taken of the location, which is then sent to the police. With the amount of oxygen in the tank, victims usually last about 24 hours. Though with the panic setting in, some die within 6 hours. A few others suffered a heart attack from the panic. They are left as a game, for the police to find the location in time, or not. So far there have been several sightings of a clown at night, though only for brief moments. In one of the photo’s, the image of the clown was visible in a car mirror caught on camera.

About 30 minutes ago, the San Francisco Police Department received a new picture from the clown. This time we have reason to believe the victim is Melany Parker, a 23 year old woman `from Northwest Berkeley.` She was reported missing by her boyfriend, `after she didn’t return from her evening jog.`

Given the circumstances, we have no time to waste. Your assignment is simple, find the location of the picture below. Before the next victim dies, tied up in a box underground, slowly suffocating while tightly wrapped in ropes.

Special Agent K. The contract is yours, if you choose to accept.

### Methodology:
The first step is to pull out imformation from the Mission Briefing that we feel is of importance.
* streets of the greater San Francisco area
* from Northwest Berkeley
* after she didn’t return from her evening jog

We can be fairly confident that Melany was abducted around the Northwest Berkeley area, as a jogger would stay fairly close to home. so we will begin our search locally.

A quick search (exiftool) of the image itself for clues does not bear fruit, umm.

Can we learn anything from a reverse image search on the photo or parts of the image that can give us some breadcrumbs?.
Unfortunately Google, Bing & TinEye etc. reverse image searches didn't provide any helpful clues.

Looks like we will just need to hunt around Google Earth for clues and hopefully get lucky!

Lets start by exploring the Northwest Berkeley area, 5 parks jump out as a "starter for ten"
* Ocean View Park
* Cedar Rose Park
* Virginia-Mcgee Totland
* Ohlone Dog Park
* Strawberry Creek Park

A quick street view of Ocean View Park area comes up blank, no sign of bins or benches that match the image.
Lets move on to the next park on the list, Cedar Rose Park.

Selecting one of the points on Street view gives us a clue, the bin and bench look very similar to the ones in the image sent by the clown.

![First clue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117080369/199009275-1cd6bde7-0e2b-4539-ba3f-2e47ae7da20b.png)

Lets explore Cedar Rose Park to see if we can locate the spot. Once we are confident we have the correct location lets move over to Google Maps and search for Cedar Rose Park, Berkeley.

Zoom in and we are able to get the name of the `dirty-mud-path.`

We now have all the imformation needed to create the password for the link file.

Extract the `flagfile-the-killer-clown.zip` with the password from the information gained above to get your contract card.
