# Contract: Where’s Klumgongyn?
![cover-wheres-klumgongyn-600x600](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117080369/205289219-1228086a-ec09-4faf-999f-d7f91a8cb26d.png)

### Difficulty: Medium

### Mission Briefing:
Greetings Special Agent K. We have quite a strange case on our hands today. Our Lead Counsel Klumgongyn, has gone missing in action.

Now don’t be alarmed, I don’t mean this in any dangerous way. Lately the company chat has been used as a dumpster for GIF wars and edgy memes. Klumgongyn was so fed up with this, that he took one of the spaceships and warped to an unknown location.

He says it’s a “surprise vacation” and won’t come back for another two weeks. This is of course unacceptable behavior and we need to find him.

After arrival he sent a picture with the message “see you in two weeks memelords”. We need you to geolocate the image so we can send in a retrieval unit to pick him up.

Whether we’ll actually find him once we’re there is another issue. Shapeshifting alien lizard like creatures are hard to spot. They’ve been posing as politicians for years now and nobody’s really caught on to them either.

Special Agent K, you have 24 hours to locate Klumgongyn. After that we’ll start refusing to reimburse his travel expenses.

### Methodology:

Let's take a closer look at the supplied image, What information can we gather?:
* Taxi company name and phone number(s)
* Sand on the road - this must mean we are near a beach.
* Hot climate judging by the vegetation and sun awning(s)
* Place of worship in the background - possibly a Mosque

A quick Google search for `My Taxi 688 2122` reveals they have a Facebook page.

Looking through their Facebook page gives us an address

Let's search for `Hithadhoo Seenu, Maldives` in <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google Maps</a>

This doesn't look too big an area to search, zooming in and selecting and switching to `Street View` only confirms that.

Okay, now to down to business, where is the location?

We know that there is a Mosque in the background with a long straight road, we also think we need to find a Cafe of sorts, let's have a look around and see if anything jumps out...

With `Street View` active, zoom in until most of the roads/streets show the names and follow the blue lines around...

We find this, however is it the incorrect orientation from the image, so let's continue searching.

This almost fits with the criteria,

Let's take a closer look.

Not even close.

Let's continue with our search.

Soon we find a result that meets our criteria.
