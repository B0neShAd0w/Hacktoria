### Difficulty: Medium

### Mission Briefing:
Greetings Special Agent K. We have quite a strange case on our hands today. Our Lead Counsel Klumgongyn, has gone missing in action.

Now don’t be alarmed, I don’t mean this in any dangerous way. Lately the company chat has been used as a dumpster for GIF wars and edgy memes. Klumgongyn was so fed up with this, that he took one of the spaceships and warped to an unknown location.

He says it’s a “surprise vacation” and won’t come back for another two weeks. This is of course unacceptable behavior and we need to find him.

After arrival he sent a picture with the message “see you in two weeks memelords”. We need you to geolocate the image so we can send in a retrieval unit to pick him up.

Whether we’ll actually find him once we’re there is another issue. Shapeshifting alien lizard like creatures are hard to spot. They’ve been posing as politicians for years now and nobody’s really caught on to them either.

Special Agent K, you have 24 hours to locate Klumgongyn. After that we’ll start refusing to reimburse his travel expenses.
