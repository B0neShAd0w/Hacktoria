### Difficulty: Hard

### Mission Briefing:
Greetings Special Agent K. After starting our collaboration with Klumgongyn and his species, a lot of the earth’s mysteries have started to clear up. Not being able to share these with the rest of the world but, suffice to say, a lot of sci-fi movies aren’t that far off from reality.

One of such interesting topics is the existence of Bigfoot, or Sasquatch as it the more formal term. These creatures roam the interiors of the American heartland and reach far up north. For several decades, people have had run-ins and sightings with these creatures.

Originally, Sasquatches evolved next to their human counterparts. But after eventually growing apart, due to our new found aversion to the discomfort of sleeping on the forest floor, they’ve taken refuge in the most rugged parts of the American wilderness. While we eventually opted for sleeping in home-delivered Swedish furniture.

As Klumgongyn now taught us, the Klumgon have been using Sasquatches to keep an eye on human behavior over the past decades. Instructing the beasts to probe human civilization for our reaction to a strange and foreign species. Needless to say, the results are still very negative. The best theory would have humans shoot the alien being and cut it’s guts open. Therefor only a select group of humans know about the existence of the Klumgon and Sasquatch.

Now that we got that introduction out of the way… During the 1970’s, a Sasquatch was spotted by a member of the US Armed Forces. While heading home from a late night diner, the soldier spotted the Sasquatch crossing the road late at night. After this sighting, the Sasquatch was never seen again. Even disappearing to it’s Klumgon handlers.

This particular Sasquatch was named “Norman” by it’s handlers. What made Norman special, was the ability to turn his nocturnal vision on and off. A genetic abnormality for the otherwise nocturnal Sasquatch. The Klumgon need Norman to reverse engineer this ability, to implement in a piece of biotech for their “Future Soldier of 2030” government program.

Needless to say, given our current collaboration, that would be a very useful piece of bio-tech. Not having to rely on clunky and limited NVG’s, but a simple set of new eyes and a microchip instead.

So, I leave you with your assignment. Find the article where this particular soldier describes the incident. This will be the starting point for our investigation. All we know, is that the article is published by someone else, chronicling the story shared by the soldier.

As always. Special Agent K, the contract is yours, if you choose to accept.

*First things first, this contract had me really frustrated for quite a while, as I didn't seem to be getting anywhere, just loads and loads of garbage web pages.*

### Methodology:
The first step is to pull out imformation from the Mission Briefing that we feel is of importance.
* During the 1970’s
* Sasquatch
* member of the US Armed Forces
* late night diner
* soldier spotted the Sasquatch crossing the road

My thought process was to use `Google Dorking`, based on the fact that there would thousand's if not millions of web pages relating to sightings of Bigfoot.

Initially this was proving to be a minefield of just random garbage, so I moved onto using Bigfoot sighting maps, again I wasted so much time and not really getting anywhere, so decided it was time to step away for a while.

Coming back to this with fresh vigor I thought that this being a hard contract would require some new thinking, so I started playing around with my Dorking queries a little more.

Eventually, after trying what felt like 100's of different queries the results started to narrow down, until I hit on the sweet Dork: `intext:"Bigfoot" intext:"sighting" intext:"late night diner"`

Reading through each result, this one seemed to be really interesting, containing a few of the "key words"

Then reading through the posts descriptions, this one stands out.

Reading through the entire post seems to match with the information we are looking for.
