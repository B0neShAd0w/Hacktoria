### Difficulty: Easy

### Mission Briefing:
Greetings Special Agent K. We have an urgent contract for the government of France. After their official departure from Mali during August 2022, only a few platoons of Special Operation Units remain in the country. Officially, these troops are not present. Unofficially, they are there to protect high ranking politicians and other French partisans.

Two days ago, during a routine escort of a Malian VIP, the convoy was ambushed by unknown insurgent forces. The VIP and most of the convoy managed to return fire and make it out alive. One of the soldiers however, Raphaël Bernard, was hit in the right leg and taken prisoner by the insurgents.

Not being able to reach private Bernard before being captured, French forces were ordered to stand down and not give chase.

Continuing efforts of the French government to locate the missing private have yielded no results. Up until this morning, when a young girl approached a local police unit. She conveyed to them she had escaped a `childrens home` where she was kept against her will. The man who helped her escape, gave her a picture of the place they were being held. We have reason to believe this man is the missing private, Raphaël Bernard.

The girl approached the officers on the `RN1 near “Posté de contrôle KAYES”.` Below you find the image given to the girl, as well as the AOR (Area of Operation) of the remaining French detachement.

It’s your job to locate the building where the French private is being held. Once the location is confirmed, French special forces will conduct a raid to extract Raphaël Bernard.

As always, Special Agent K. The contract is yours, if you choose to accept.

### Methodology:
The first step is to pull out imformation from the Mission Briefing that we feel is of importance.
* childrens home
* RN1 near “Posté de contrôle KAYES”

Lets fire up Google Earth and search for “Posté de contrôle KAYES”, as we know from the Mission Briefing that this is where the girl approached officers. 
Note: we need to zoom out a little to find where the ambush happened (marked by small red circle).

We can be fairly confident that the girl hasn't traveled a large distance, so we will concentrate our search around the KAYES area. So lets try searching for "childrens homes KAYES".

Switching to Street View gives us a few locations to have a look at. The first one we pick has a building of similar design, we could be in the correct place, lets keep searching around. Finally we find an exact match for the image supplied.

We now have all the imformation needed to create the password for the link file.

Extract the `flagfile-prisoner-of-war.zip` with the password from the information gained above to get your contract card.
